## Mention


### Configuration

The feed is asynchronous list that is loaded from server (`@` marker) after random delay:

- 80% of requests completes in 100-300ms.
- 20% of requests completes in 600-1000ms.

In order to run the server go to the `ckeditor5-mention/dev-server/` and run:

```sh
node index.js
```  

### Interaction

Controlling the cache:

- You can enable caching mechanism in `getFeed()` method - if checked it will save results and load them from cache for the same query.s
- If cache is disable no loading nor saving will be performed.
