## Mention


### Configuration

The feed is asynchronous list that is loaded from server (`@` marker) after random delay:

- 60% of requests completes in 150ms.
- 40% of requests completes in 400ms, 1s, 2s or 4s.

In order to run the server go to the `tests/_utils/asyncserver/` and run:

```sh
node index.js
```  

### Interaction

Controlling the cache:

- You can enable caching mechanism in `getFeed()` method - if checked it will save results and load them from cache for the same query.s
- If cache is disable no loading nor saving will be performed.
